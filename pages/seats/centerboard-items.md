>The CB cover was to be secured by screwing into the epoxy plugs I poured around the CB opening.  When I attempted to screw into these epoxy plugs, the epoxy didn’t take the screw and instead began to chip out the epoxy and the screw slipped.  I’ll instead need to screw down into the cleating and forget about the epoxy plugs
