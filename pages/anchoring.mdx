# Anchoring

## Howard's system

Anchor is pre rigged set and on the ready, with moused chain and rode. Moused chain means to have the shackle moused shut with wire. Bitter end of anchor line is already made fast to a padeye or dedicated cleat, anchor rode always set by permanent lead forward through a captive chock and back into the cockpit anchor storage place (already affixed to the anchor).

A thin 15 foot retrieve line tied around the anchor line (with a bowline) forward of the closed bow chock, bitter end made off on a small cleat in cockpit. Anchor tie down strap released (shock cord or some easy one hand use strap is best). Boat feathered head to wind, anchor lowered (never tossed) over the side amidship as way forward is killed/sail rig dropped, anchor line plays out as boat backs down, anchor line made off to dedicated cleat (6") at desired scope.

Next morning still windy or not. Sail raised, sheet fully free, stand up behind cuddy, anchor rode is drawn aft over starboard cabin top/side deck. I mounted/off set one bow chock to starboard (I have two, one port and one starboard of centerline for Bahamian moor scheme) this starboard mount facilitates falling off on to starboard tack, why not, nice if in a crowd of moving boats as it gives instant right of way. Center location is just fine too.

I draw the anchor rode to a pre mark on the anchor line showing the anchor hanging down approx 10feet from the bow, (boat is moving at this time likely forward due to pulling of anchor line and likely making way (direction) on one tack or the other. At the 10 foot hang down length I make off the anchor line (quick wraps) and I then draw the retrieve line aft and pull the the approx 10 feet of anchor rode and thus the anchor to the starboard side and haul it aboard. Trim sail, begin to sail away and sort anchor once underway.
All this holds true for motoring, just easier, perhaps.

1. You only need one hawsepipe per anchor. I mount it adjacent to the 4" screw in port. Hawsepipes can be plastic, galvanized, bronze, stainless, etc. Mine are both bronze.

2. I suggest the hinged lid (anchor mount) over your lazarette hatch, easy to make, light weight and practical. Mine is painted, with anchor chocks and tie downs for two nested anchors. It is covered with an outdoor carpet type material I cut from a door mat.

3. Pre mark your anchor rode with a sew though of black course thread or indelible marker or paint. Have your anchor stowed aft and where the rode goes through the captive bow chock is where you make the mark.

Make a second mark on the rode (red) forward of the black mark when the anchor is up off the bottom and hanging in a sail away position, meaning just below the stem/bottom. This may be very handy to know sometime in a tight spot when you have to:

a. Sail your anchor to a new location. Sometimes sailing off anchor is a convenience, I do it alot.

b. Sail off anchor with no time to actually haul it all the way in because of a lee shore, rocks, whatever prevents you from a more leisurely haul up and stow.

4. Important- Get a 12 to 15 foot 1/4" or 3/16" braided line, tie a bowline in one end around the anchor rode that lies between the anchor and the captive bow chock. Tie off the other end to a small cleat near or on bulkhead 5.

When you deploy your anchor the bowline retrieve line goes out and hangs on the anchor line draped around the rode between the bow chock and the deep or is perhaps just under water.

When you want to retrieve your anchor pull it up through the bow chock to the black mark on the rode then with the retrieve line pull the anchor aft to the cockpit where you are standing just aft of the cuddy cabin, lift it up and into the footwell or onto the cockpit sole, feed the anchor line into the large mouth open canvas bag you have on the seat, then chain and anchor, push it aft and sail away ready to drop anchor around the next corner. Later you can feed rode into hawsepipe or maybe not until the end of your cruise.

Why not an open bow chock?
> If by chance (in a strong wind) your anchor line comes out of an open bow chock you will be drawing your boat sideways into the wind to pull up the anchor. This is the beginning of a potentially very bad day.

Anchor Types?
> At the Small Craft Skills Academy in Michigan a couple years ago we pulled out 8 or 10 different anchors that were on attendants boats and tested them for distance to set and ability to reset after pulling out. The anchors that were at the top of the list were the Northill and the Rochna/Manson.

> The Northill is a folding fisherman type anchor that was originally standard equipment in sea planes. They are sadly no longer made but can be found used. They were made either in stainless or galvanized. I was able to find a 6# and a 13# galvanized on craigslist for a total cost of $130, about the same cost or less than one new quality anchor. Both anchors are in great condition. These will nest together compactly for storage. I admit that I haven't finished my scamp yet and tested them. Our test anchor came from Howard Rice and I'll take his word on its' real world performance.

> The Rocna was a great anchor but would consume a lot more space to store.
