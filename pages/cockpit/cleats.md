## Cool Ideas

- [Filler Board Cupholder / Meal Station](https://buildinghagoth.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/my-trangia-cooking-system/)
- [Filler Board Storage](https://buildinghagoth.wordpress.com/2018/02/13/i-had-a-grate-idea/), this is very cool but difficult for me to retrofit at this point potentially... ?
